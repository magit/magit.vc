title: Sponsor my work using an IBAN bank transfer
---

If you have a European bank account, using that to make a [SWIFT] transaction to
either my EUR or CHF [IBAN] account, is the cheapest option.  If you transfer
another currency, there will be a currency conversion fees, but other than that
there should be no fees.

[SWIFT]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT
[IBAN]:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number

## **CHF** account details

My IBAN is **CH92 0077 0016 0444 2057 7**.

Before completing the transaction make sure you are sending money to **Jonas
Bernoulli** and that you _use **CHF (Swiss franks)** as the currency_.

You probably won't need this information, but in case your bank asks for it:
SWIFT is **BKBBCHBB**, BIC is **BKBBCHBBXXX**, the bank's name is **Basler
Kantonalbank**, and the clearing-number is **770**.

## **EUR** account details

My IBAN is **CH73 0077 0251 3226 4200 6**.

Before completing the transaction make sure you are sending money to **Jonas
Bernoulli** and that you _use **EUR** as the currency_.

You probably won't need this information, but in case your bank asks for it:
SWIFT is **BKBBCHBB**, BIC is **BKBBCHBBXXX**, the bank's name is **Basler
Kantonalbank**, and the clearing-number is **770**.

*I can no longer accept payments to a USD bank account.  I used to use Wise
to receive USD and EUR transfers, but their accounts are inherently unsafe,
so I cannot do that anymore.  If I previously convinced to use this method,
then I kindly ask you to use [another payment method](/donate) going forward.
Thanks!*
