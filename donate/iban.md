title: Sponsor my work using an IBAN bank transfer
---

If you have a **European bank account**, then
[IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number) is a
good option to transfer money to me.

<h2>CHF account details</h2>

My IBAN is **CH92 0077 0016 0444 2057 7**.

Before completing the transaction make sure you are sending money to **Jonas
Bernoulli** and that you _use **CHF (Swiss franks)** as the currency_.

You probably won't need this information, but in case your bank asks for it:
SWIFT is **BKBBCHBB**, BIC is **BKBBCHBBXXX**, the bank's name is **Basler
Kantonalbank**, and the clearing-number is **770**.

<h2>EUR account details</h2>

My IBAN is **CH73 0077 0251 3226 4200 6**.

Before completing the transaction make sure you are sending money to **Jonas
Bernoulli** and that you _use **EUR** as the currency_.

You probably won't need this information, but in case your bank asks for it:
SWIFT is **BKBBCHBB**, BIC is **BKBBCHBBXXX**, the bank's name is **Basler
Kantonalbank**, and the clearing-number is **770**.

*I can no longer accept payments to an USD bank account.  I used Wise for that
before, but their accounts are inherently unsafe.  I apologize to everyone I
previously convinced to use this method and kindly ask you to use [another
payment method](/donate) going forward.  Thanks!*
