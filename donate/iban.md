If you have a **European bank account**, then
[IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number)
is the best option to transfer money to me.  For non-European bank
accounts this may also be the best option; a notable exception are US
bank accounts.

<h2>Transaction details</h2>

IBAN is **CH92 0077 0016 0444 2057 7**.  Before completing the transaction make
sure you are sending money to **Jonas Bernoulli** and that you use **CHF**
(Swiss franks) as the currency.

You probably won't need this information, but in case your bank asks for it:
SWIFT is **BKBBCHBB**, BIC is **BKBBCHBBXXX**, the bank's name is **Basler
Kantonalbank**, and the clearing-number is **770**.

*If you have a US bank account, then instead make an [ACH](/donate/ach/)
direct deposit.  Some other donation options are [available](/donate).*
