To avoid us ending up paying currency conversion fees twice, only pay using
USD or EUR if your payment source is in one of these currencies.  Most of my
expenses are in CHF.

- Make a payment in [CHF](https://buy.stripe.com/cN2eWMbtB5qn55mbIJ).
- Make a payment in [USD](https://buy.stripe.com/28o15W8hp8Cz0P68wy).
- Make a payment in [EUR](https://buy.stripe.com/3cseWMapxcSP9lC28b).
