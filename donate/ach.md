title: Sponsor my work using a US bank transfer (ach)
---

If you want to make a transaction from **your US bank account**, you should
transfer money to **my US bank account**, because transfering from that account
to my Swiss bank account is fairly cheap, while transfering money from your US
account to my Swiss account is likely extremely expensive.

You should make an **ACH** direct deposit, which should be fairly cheap or even
free.  If you are aware of a cheaper option then use that of course (and please
*tell me about it* so that I can update these instructions).

***Avoid wire transfers** as they are very expensive for you and costs me $4 per
incoming transaction as well.  My new US bank account does not support Zelle.*

<h2>Transaction details</h2>

- Account holder: Jonas Remigius Bernoulli
- Routing number: 084009519
- Account number: 9600004435885604
- Account type: Checking

You probably won't have to provide the name and address of the bank, but it
might be auto-filled for you.  If so, you should see one of the following two
companies and their address.  (I have a [wise.com](https://wise.com) account
and they partner with *Evolve Bank and Trust* for US bank accounts.)

*If you have a non-US bank account, then instead make an [IBAN](/donate/iban/)
transaction.  Some other donation options are [available](/donate).*
