# Please help making Magit even better

Many users are quite excited about Magit in its current
form, and I am thankful for all the positive feedback.

But I believe that, with your help, I can make it even
better.  Please consider supporting my continuous work on

If you have a **European bank account**, then
[IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number)
is the best option to transfer money to me.  For non-European bank
accounts this may also be the best option; a notable exception are US
bank accounts.

My IBAN is **CH92 0077 0016 0444 2057 7**.  Before completing the
transaction make sure you are sending money to **Jonas Bernoulli**.

(SWIFT is **BKBBCHBB**, BIC is **BKBBCHBBXXX**, and Clearing-Nr. is
**770**)

  <img class="donate"
       title="Donate using Zelle"
       alt="Donate using Zelle"
       src="/assets/zelle.png"></h1>

If you have an **US bank account**, then
[Zelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelle_(payment_service)) may be
the best option to transfer money to me.  Zelle is supported by at
least Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, US
Bank, Citibank and Wells Fargo.

Login to your online banking and send money to the email address
**jonas(at)bernoul(dot)li**.  Before completing the transation double
check the email address.

Note that unlike other US-internal money transfer methods Zelle is
free of charge.  If you have never used Zelle before you should be
able to set it up in less than ten minutes.

# FAQ 1: Which payment method do you prefer?

<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/tarsius">
  <img class="donate"
       title="Donate using Github Sponsors"
       alt="Donate using Github Sponsors"
       src="/assets/github-sponsors-50px.png"></a>

I prefer [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tarsius)
because that currently is not only completely free of fees but Github
actually matches your contribution!  You can read about that
[here](https://help.github.com/en/github/supporting-the-open-source-community-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors).

If that weren't the case, then I would prefer the above bank transfer
methods because they are also free of charge.

# FAQ 2: Can you send me a bill?

Of course! Just ask me for one in an email.

By the way, while your employer may not have a budget for donations to
free software, they might have one to **buy** any software or support.
I would be happy to send them such a bill.

# FAQ 3: Do you accept any other donation methods?

Yes, a few other donation methods are available and while they are
less populare than the options mentioned above you are of course more
than welcome to use your favorite.
