# FAQ 1: What other payment options do you accept?

Please keep scrolling or [jump there](#alt).

# FAQ 2: What payment option do you prefer?

I prefer options that come with no, or very, low fees.  Of course I like these
options because it means I get more money, but it is equally important who does
*not* get a cut when we avoid unnecessary fees.

In practical terms, that means that I prefer bank transfers.  Nowadays many
banks have web-pages and apps, that make it nearly as simple to transfer money
as the offerings of platforms that focus solely on money transfer.  So even
if you avoided using them in the past, it might be worth giving them another
chance.

**Update**, since I am gaining many new supporters right now.  Choose the
payment method **you** *are most comfortable with*, given the time you are
willing to invest to set that up.  As we have just learned, putting too many
eggs in one basket is risky.  GitHub Sponsors dropping support for PayPal is a
major issue exactly because that was by far the most popular option.  That being
said, if you have the time, I still encourage you do go with the solution that
has the smallest fees.

# FAQ 3: I already use something else for donations.  Can I stick to that?

Of course I welcome all donations!  Since most developers only accept donations
through one of the popular donation platforms, it makes sense to stick to that
for all your donations.  It is certainly better to make donations using an
expensive offering, than it is to make no donations at all because doing so
would be too time consuming.

Currently only a tiny fractions of the donations that I receive are done using
bank transfers, so don't feel bad if you don't do that either.  Still, it might
be worth investing some time, making sure a greater part of your donations reach
the intended recipients.

# FAQ 4: Can you send me a bill?

~~Of course! Just ask me for one in an email.~~  Sadly, it depends.  Apparently
EU countries now require that VAT is being payed even for small earnings for
digital services.  In each country individually, using the country-specific
platform and rules.  I cannot afford a lawyer to be certain about these things,
and I likely would have to invest hours per country to figure out how to give
them money.  If I have to spend all that time to pay taxes for $100, then that
sadly is not worth the effort and legal uncertainty.

Of course if you intend to pay considerably more, then that is well worth the
effort.  If not, then consider whether you can make a donation instead of a
payment.  If you cannot do that but would have payed otherwise, then please
give me a heads up.  If the lose of donations is considerable enough because
of this, then it might be worth finding another solution.

By the way, while your employer may not have a budget for donations to free
software, they might have one to **buy** any software or support.  I would be
happy to send them such a bill.  But of course the above caveat applies in that
case too.

# Bank transfers

- Use [ACH](/donate/ach.html) direct deposit if you have an US bank account.
- Use [IBAN](/donate/iban.html) if you have a European account.  This might
  also work for other non-US bank account.

# Payment processors

Compared to (at least European) banks these charge higher fees.

- [Stripe](/donate/stripe.html)
- [Paypal](/donate/paypal.html)

# Donation platforms

- [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tarsius/)

  This is by far the most popular option among my backers.  They currently do
  not charge any fees themselves, but the fees of Stripe and your credit card
  company still apply.

- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/tarsius/)

  This is the second most popular option among my backers.  They charge very
  high fees, including some hidden fees.  Please avoid them going forward; if
  all the people you back on there also accept donations elsewhere, then you
  might even want to move away from this platform.
  
- [Opencollective](https://opencollective.com/magit/)

  Not popular among my backers.  Because I have opted to use no "fiscal host"
  they charge no additional fees.  As a consequence, they do however ask you
  to also donate to them when you are donating to me (but you can decline).

- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/magit/)

  Gaining in popularity.  They have only the best intentions and they do not
  charge any additional fees.
