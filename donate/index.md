# Bank transfers

Bank transfers have the advantage that there are *no fees* (in Europe) or
*smaller fees* compared to payment processors (in the USA).

- Use [ACH](/donate/ach.html) direct deposit if you have an US bank account.

- Use [IBAN](/donate/iban.html) if you have a European account.  This might
  also work for other non-US bank account.

# Payment processors

Compared to banks these charge much higher fees.

- [Stripe](/donate/stripe.html)

- [Paypal](/donate/paypal.html)

# Donation platforms

When using a donation platform, payments are made with the help of a payment
processor, so the fees of the processor still apply.

If a donation platform charges additional fees, on top of the fees by the used
payment processor, then that is noted below.

- [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tarsius/)

- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/magit/)

- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/tarsius/)

  They charge *very high fees*, including some hidden fees.  Please consider
  using another platform.
  
- [Opencollective](https://opencollective.com/magit/)

  They ask you to donate to them as well, but you can decline.

# FAQ 1: What payment option do you prefer?

I prefer options that come with no, or very low, fees.  Of course I like these
options because it means I get more money, but it is equally important who does
*not* get a cut when we avoid unnecessary fees.

In practical terms, that means that I prefer bank transfers.

# FAQ 2: I already use something else for donations.  Can I stick to that?

Of course I welcome all donations!  Since most developers only accept donations
through one of the popular donation platforms, it makes sense to stick to that
for all your donations.  It is certainly better to make donations using an
expensive offering, than it is to make no donations at all.

# FAQ 3: Can you send me a bill?

If you are located within the EU, then I unfortunately cannot do that, because
the administrative hurdles are too high.  If you are located elsewhere, then I
would be happy to send you a bill.

By the way, while your employer may not have a budget for donations, they might
have one to *buy* any software or support.  I would be happy to send them such
a bill.  But of course the above caveat applies in that case too.
