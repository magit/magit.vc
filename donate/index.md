# Bank transfers

If you have a European bank account, using that to make a [SWIFT] transaction to
either my EUR or CHF [IBAN] account, is the cheapest option.  If you transfer
another currency, there will be a currency conversion fees, but other than that
there should be no fees.

[IBAN]:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number

# Payment processors

- [Stripe](/donate/stripe.html)
- [Paypal](/donate/paypal.html)

# Donation platforms

When using a donation platform, payments are made with the help of a payment
processor, so the fees of the processor still apply.

If a donation platform charges additional fees, on top of the fees by the used
payment processor, then that is noted below.

- [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tarsius/)
- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/magit/)
- [Opencollective](https://opencollective.com/magit/) They ask you to donate
  to them as well, but you can decline.
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/tarsius/) They charge *very high fees*,
  including some hidden fees.  Please consider using another platform.
