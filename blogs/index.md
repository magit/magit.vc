* [Magit, the one and only](https://www.manueluberti.eu/emacs/2017/11/09/magit)

  Nowadays it is basically impossible to land in a group of Emacs
  enthusiasts without someone talking rapturously about the wonders of
  Magit. If you listen closely, the words resemble a chant: “You wish
  you could do it with Git, until you experience the great Magit.”

  Be warned: the following story goes along those magic lines.

* [Why You Should Use Magit: A Git Porcelain Inside Emacs](https://www.mojotech.com/blog/why-you-should-use-magit-git-porcelain-inside-emacs) by Matthew Forsyth — 2017.10

  Magit is the holy grail of workspace tools, allowing Git users to
  handle all aspects of source control directly from within Emacs. But
  rather than merely lauding Magit and asking you the reader to take
  my recommendation at face value, I'd like to share a couple of
  recent events that reminded me why Magit is such a powerful tool.

* [It’s Magit! And you’re the magician!](https://endlessparentheses.com/it-s-magit-and-you-re-the-magician.html) by Artur Malabarba — 2017.9 

  I could go on and on about the virtues of this gem. It’s probably
  the package that most saves me time, and has taught me more about
  git than I learned reading a whole book on it. But that’s all just
  sparks and glitter on top of the real show. For Magit is a magic
  show, and its real feature is making you the magician.

* [Git's selective commits plus Magit are a killer feature for me](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GitSelectiveCommitWithMagit) by Chris Siebenmann — 2016.9

* [I like Magit, the GNU Emacs package for Git](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/MagitPraise) by Chris Siebenmann — 2015.12

  Magit rocks for selectively staging changes, so much so that I think
  it's worth turning to GNU Emacs with Magit for this if you need it,
  even if you regularly edit in something else.

* [Why I Don't Hate Git: Hidden Consistency](http://blog.danielgempesaw.com/post/122193964104/why-i-dont-hate-git-hidden-consistency-armin?utm_source=tuicool) by Daniel Gempesaw — 2015.6

  I don’t hate git solely because of magit. Although it is an Emacs
  package, I strongly recommend it even to non-Emacs users just
  because of how useful it is.

  I’m actually so dependent on magit that I’m significantly less
  effective with other vc’s since they don’t have a magit-like
  frontend for me to use.

* [Magit](http://randycoulman.com/blog/2014/10/21/magit/) by Randy Coulman — 2014.10

  When we decided to migrate to Git a few years ago, I decided to try
  Magit in Emacs as a front-end, and I’ve never looked back.

Some users have also published [screencasts](/screencasts)
and [wrote](/quotes) nice things I like to quote.
